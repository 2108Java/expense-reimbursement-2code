### Expense Reimbursement System

The Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) will manage the process of reimbursing employees for expenses incurred while on company time.

### Overview

The ERS contains a Login page for both employees and managers. When logging onto the employees page, the employee will be redirected to their personal page to review their statuses on Reimbursements. The employee will see their previous approved, denied or pending Reimbursement requests. At the bottom of the page is a link that will redirect you to another page to make another Reimbursement request. After fulling in the information, you will be redirected back to your personal page and immediately see the new pending request.

### Systems Used

Some technical requirements to use JDBC to connect to PostgreSQL, AWS RDS/EC2, JavaScript, Bootstrapping, AJAX, Mockito,JUnit, Postman, and Log4J.
